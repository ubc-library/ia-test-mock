# ia-test-mock
A stripped-down bootstrap-based site mockup that simulates clicking through a menu for the purposes of user-testing information architectures and menu structures.

This example includes three different possible menu structures for the Irving K. Barber Learning Center. 

# Usage

To use: Clone this repo, and use 'bootstrap-ai-test-template.html' as a template to create the menu structure you would like to test using the standard bootstrap menu classes and structure (you can copy and paste existing code to add more options). If testing multiple structures, it may be convenient to modify the 'index.html' file to provide links to each of the files.
